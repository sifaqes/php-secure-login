PHP Secure Login Secure Login: Licencia gnu.org copia de siphax 
==============
Includ js - bootstrap

A version of the WikiHow page is saved with this project as 'php-secure-login.odt'.


Username	: test_user 
Email		: test@example.com 
Password	: 6ZaxN2Vzm9NUJT2y

The registration page is now implemented, so you can register as many users as you like.  However you may still need the test_user for testing purposes in the future when we come to adding roles to users.

I'm happy to receive any suggestions (siphaxzer@gmail.com).  And if anyone would like to help...
